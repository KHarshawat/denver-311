**Download dependencies** in the command line: ` bundle `

#### Local Development
1. Jekyll compiles everything into a static site in the _site folder. In order to get the latest changes and start the server, use the following command: `jekyll serve --watch`
1. Navigate to [localhost:4000][local] to preview the site. Most changes will update immediately. The exception is changes to *_config.yml*. The server will need to be restarted in that case.

[local]: http://localhost:4000  

#### Deployment
1. Compile the site: `jekyll build`
1. Deploy contents of */_site* to server.

#### ETL Scripts
[Rake][] tasks exist for each section of the data visualization. These tasks query the open data portal and update the csv files located in /data with the latest data. These can be set to run on a schedule through task scheduler (windows), a cron job (others), or heroku scheduler (heroku). Errors output to the console.
* List all tasks: `rake -T`
* Run all tasks: `rake`
